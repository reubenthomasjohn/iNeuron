# Assignment No.1

### Q1: Describe the significance of AWS.
Firstly, AWS is a cloud service provider. Hence, using AWS is significantly better than using on-premise datacentres for a host of reasons. A few being improved security, adoption of a pay-as-you go model, ability to focus on producing value, and not having to setup the resources physically. Fault tolerance, greater reliability and so on. Secondly, AWS is the best of the top 3 CSPâ€™s (AWS, GCP, Azure). It has the most complete vision, and the best ability to carry out its vision as well, according to a study conducted by Gartner.

### Q2: Explain what EC2 is?
EC2 is an abbreviation for Elastic Compute Cloud, and many call it the backbone of AWS, since most service offerings of AWS use EC2 underneath. It provides scalable computing capacity in the AWS cloud. Using EC2 eliminates the need to invest in on-premise hardware. EC2 can be used to launch, configure security and networking as well. Additionally, EC2 can be used to handle increasing traffic, spikes in traffic and so on. It is a highly versatile and important offering in the AWS roster. 

### Q3: Explain the working of S3 and list various types of instances.
S3 is an abbreviation for Simple Storage Service. It allows a user to store data in the form of objects. It is scalable, has features for improving availability, and is very secure. All kinds of data from all kinds of sources such as data storage for data lakes, websites, IoT etc. can be stored using S3. Additionally, S3 can be optimised, organised, and access controlled using IAM. Data is stored in the form of objects, and different objects are put into what AWS calls S3 buckets.
Types of instances: 
1.	The general purpose S3 offering is called S3 standard
2.	S3 Intelligent-Tiering
3.	S3 Standard Infrequent Access
4.	S3 One Zone -IA
5.	S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
6.	S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
7.	S3 Glacier Deep Archive

### Q4: Explain the importance of IAM in AWS.
Since the customer is responsible for security in the cloud, IAM is a crucial service. It allows the administrator to give different users the required permissions to carry out their job, while not allowing for unauthorized access. It manages different identities and groups of users, and gives them permissions to different resources and operations through the use of policies. It also allows for cost optimizations through the use of policies and groups.
